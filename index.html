							<h3>Who I am</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							I am a 23 year-old software developer from Atlanta. I grew up in Marietta, GA and
							attended the University of Georgia where I majored in Biology and graduated in spring
							2019 with a B.S. in Biology. The semester after graduation I decided to pursue
							coding because it was something I always had an interest in and I wanted to work
							in an industry that I enjoyed. I had taught myself basic html, css and javascript,
							however I wanted a more formal education so I decided to enroll in the Georgia Tech
							coding boot camp after my final semester in Athens. I began my coding boot camp in
							Febuary 2020 and finished in August 2020. Aside from coding, I enjoy being active and
							playing/watching sports. I'm a huge college football and soccer fan, but I do watch
							all of the Atlanta sports teams regularly. I enjoy the outdoors and I am hoping to
							travel more once I get settled down and begin my career in software development.

							<h3>My Accomplishments</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							I graduated high school in May 2015 with Honors. I had a 3.9 GPA and 9 AP classes
							to my name. I then attended the University of Georgia the ensuing fall semester.
							After 4 1/2 years at UGA, I graduated with honors with a B.S. in Biology while also
							having been directly involved in over 7 clubs and organizations on campus. After
							graduating UGA, I pursued Georgia Tech coding boot camp and graduated in
							August 2020. During boot camp, I completed over 20 individual assignments and
							projects, while also completing 3 team projects where I had to interact with my
							team on a daily basis. What I learned throughout my schooling was that time
							management and the ability to quickly learn new information was and continues to
							be vital to my success. I always adapted to situations I was presented and I always
							found a way to get my job done while also helping others when they needed. I
							learned that being able to communicate with my peers and my professors was essential
							for my long-term success. I believe that my ability to quickly adapt to new situation
							as well as my ability to work well alongside others makes me a good candidate for
							development.

							<h3>My Future Goals</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							The picture above was taken during my time in Cuzco, Peru in May of 2018. I, alongside
							14 others from various colleges around the southeast, traveled to Cuzco for two weeks
							to embark on a medical trip. My team, which consisted pre-dental students, traveled
							alongside a pre-med team. Together we partered with local doctors and dentists to
							set up a free heathcare clinic for underserved communities outside of Cuzco. We
							actively helped our respective medical leaders attend to patients for close to 10
							hours a day 10 of the 14 days we were in Peru. This was by far the most rewarding
							experience of my life. My previous goal before switching to software development
							was to join Doctors Without Borders and to devote a portion of my life to a
							humanitarian cause. My current goal is to help great organizations like Doctors
							Without Borders in a new role providing infrastructure and tech to humanitarian
							organizations.
